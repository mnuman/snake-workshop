## Requirements

 - 1 workshop leader.
 - 0 or more mentors according to the number of participants
 - sbt + nodejs setup

## Part 1: Getting started

Leader makes a small presentation to introduce:

 - the Scala knowledge needed to complete the workshop
 - the basics of the game: the grid system, eating, borders, moving

## Part 2: Coding

Participants receive the template for the project.
The empty template compiles and renders something.

The Leader tells to the participants in what order to fill in the blanks,
waits some time for each part. At the end stuck participants are helped.
